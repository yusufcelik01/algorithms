# Knut-Morris-Pratt string matching 
the compiled kmp executable takes 2 lines from stdin first line and second line should contain the pattern to be searched and the text that pattern is being searched respectively. As output gives an valid shift at each line and the end reports the number of total valid shifts

For example, the following lines
```
make kmp-string-matching
./kmp-string-matching
abac
ababac
```
gives the output:
```

```
